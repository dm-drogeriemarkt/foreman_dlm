# Foreman Distributed Lock Manager

This is a plugin for Foreman that allows Foreman to act as a distributed lock manager.
Updates are key to security, but updates of an operating system are hard to apply and existing tools are hard to manage at scale. This might lead to a large drift between important security updates becoming available and all your hosts being successfully patched. Security experts recommend to install updates as soon as they come available. The ability to easily update software is the most effective way to improve server security. Automation is key to ensure this goal is reached.
This plug-in aims to provide painless updates of the operating system. This keeps your company more secure and frees up resources of your operations team for more important tasks.

With this plugin servers can acquire a lock in Foreman to ensure only one server in a cluster installs updates at the same time. This can successfully prevent service disruptions.

## Compatibility

| Foreman Version | Plugin Version |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| >= 1.15         | ~> 0.1         |
| >= 1.17         | ~> 1.0         |

## Installation

See [Plugins install instructions](https://theforeman.org/plugins/)
for how to install Foreman plugins.
On Enterprise Linux, you need to install the package `tfm-rubygem-foreman_dlm`.

## Usage

Servers are identified by their puppet certificates. Support for using subscription-manager certificates is planned, but currently not implemented.
Here you find a usage example using `curl` that shows how to acquire the `test` lock. The lock will be created if it does not exist.

```
curl -D - -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --key $(puppet config print hostprivkey) --cert $(puppet config print hostcert) -X PUT https://foreman.example.com/api/dlmlocks/test/lock
```

Use the HTTP method `GET` to show a lock, `PUT` to acquire a lock and `DELETE` to release a lock.
Foreman will respond with the HTTP status code `200 OK` if the action was successful and `412 Precondition Failed` if the lock could not be acquired or release. This may happen, if the lock is taken by another host.

To process the HTTP status code in a bash script, you can do something like this:
```
curl --write-out %{http_code} -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -sS -o /dev/null -X PUT --key $(puppet config print hostprivkey) --cert $(puppet config print hostcert) https://foreman.example.com/api/dlmlocks/test/lock
```

## Client tooling

A [client counterpart](https://github.com/schlitzered/foreman_dlm_updater) has been developed to make it easier for servers that want to acquire a lock to use this Foreman plug-in.

## Note about curl on macOS

macOS uses curl with a different ssl library which gets problematic testing the cert-signed requests.
The Error:
`WARNING: SSL: CURLOPT_SSLKEY is ignored by Secure Transport. The private key must be in the Keychain.`

A fix is described here:
https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/283

```
$ brew install curl --with-openssl
$ brew link curl --force
```

After that `curl --version` changes from
```
$ curl --version
curl 7.54.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin16.0) libcurl/7.54.0 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.8
```
to
```
$ curl --version
curl 7.56.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0) libcurl/7.56.1 OpenSSL/1.0.2m zlib/1.2.8
```
